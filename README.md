# Awesome Urban Datasets

This is a curated list of publicly available urban datasets, gathered over the years. The datasets are divided by their broad topic (natural phenomena, human-driven phenomena, build environment, others), using the same approach as the one used in our [survey of 3D urban analytics](https://urbantk.org/survey-3d/). In each topic, you will find datasets with different types (e.g., timeseries, images, audio) and sizes.

In **natural phenomena**, we list datasets that are primarily describing natural phenomena (e.g., sunlight access / shadow, wind & ventilation, climate). 
In **human-driven phenomena**, we list datasets that are primarily describing phenomena driven by human factors (e.g., traffic, energy modeling or energy potential assessment, noise & sound propagation, property cadastre). 
In **built & natural environment**, we list datasets that are primarily describing the built and natural environment (e.g., infrastructure, buildings, sidewalks, street networks, trees). 

The main goal of this list is to offer a straightforward way to discover urban datasets that can be of interest to users in multiple domains: computer science (e.g., data analytics, data mining, visualization, machine learning, computer vision), social science (e.g., urban planning, economics), climate science, public health, etc.

This list is constantly being updated. Contributions are greatly appreciated.
